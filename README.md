# DummyBansGenerator
The python script has a function that allows you to generate dummy bans that exports as a CSV file, which is useful for being able to make dummy ban IDs like with Discord that have more things with them.

# Use
```python 
from bans import create_dummy_bans
create_dummy_bans(1000, 'bans')
```
The usage above uses the function as so
```python
create_dummy_bans(number_of_bans,ban_csv_file_name)
```

More features to come soon which will allow for more usage for creating dummy bans (Right now it is suited for Discord).
